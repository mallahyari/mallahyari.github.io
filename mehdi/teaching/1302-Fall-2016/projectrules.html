           	<h2 style="text-align:center">Ground rules concerning programming projects</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>All programming projects will be done on Linux, using Sun's Java, version 1.8.</li>
            <li>Programming projects are due at <span style="font-style: italic">midnight</span> of the due date.</li>
            <li>There are no  scheduled  labs for this class (unlike CSCI 1301). Therefore, all programming projects will be done  by students <em>individually</em>, on their own time.</li>
            <li>All programming projects must be submitted <span style="font-style: italic">electronically</span> (using the <span class="code_format">submit</span> utility) on our departmental server <span class="code_format">nike</span>. The submitted programs must compile and run on <span class="code_format">nike</span>, using Sun's Java, version 1.8, available on <span class="code_format">nike</span>. It is your responsibility to upload your program  files to the server, compile the program and test it to make sure it runs correctly.</li>
            <li>It is expected that you will be developing your projects on <span class="code_format">nike</span>, since learning to use Unix/Linux is one of the objectives of this course. However, if you decide to develop your projects on a different system (MS Windows, Mac OS X, or a different Unix/Linux system), even using an IDE (Eclipse, NetBeans), you must transfer your project to <span class="code_format">nike</span>, <strong>make sure that it compiles properly using the Java compiler available on <span class="code_format">nike</span>, test it</strong>, and then submit it for grading.</li>
            <li>You should  <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic">start early</span> on programming assignments and I will remind everyone of this  	  several times.   	  One suggestion: if you think that you can do a program in 2 days  	  and you have 1 week to do it, do it during the <em>first</em> two days and enjoy the rest of the week for other things.</li>
            <li>If you are sick and have appropriate documentation, <strong>always let me know  	  as soon as you get sick</strong>. It will be to your disadvantage to tell me after  	  the fact that you were sick; you may not be excused from the regular due date.</li>
          </ul>
