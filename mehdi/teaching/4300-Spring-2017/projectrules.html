            <ul>
            	<li><strong>Individual Programming Assignments:</strong> There will be a few individual programming assignments. You may not help another student or get help from any other person except the instructor and teaching assistants. You may not incorporate code from any other source, including our textbook, except as specifically authorized by the instructor. If you run across code that seems useful, you may study it, type it in and run it; but you must then erase it and write your own code. You may discuss ideas, but not code, with other students.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Group Projects: </strong>Same as for the individual exercises, except that you may help out other students in your group. However, each piece of code must be clearly labeled with the authorship 
                </li>
                <li><strong>Group Term Project:</strong> <p>Please sign up in teams of four on eLC. Each team will choose its own project in consultation from me. I especially encourage teams to develop some kind of e-commerce site. It needs to be a Web site, not a native app (this is a course in Web Programming, after all!) </p>
                <p>I will authorize smaller or larger teams only after we see whether the enrollment for this course is divisible by four or not. If a team member drops the course, the rest of the team will need to alter the project’s scope. I will merge teams only under extraordinary circumstances.</p>
                <p>As part of this project, your team will deliver several presentations to the class, describing your progress through the project. The topics should be roughly thus:
                <ol>
                <li>Overview of the project</li>
                <li>Design artifacts: page mockups, class diagrams, and data model</li>
                <li>Technical and managerial challenges</li>
                <li>It’s done! Demo and lessons learned</li>
                </ol>
            </ul>
           </div>
