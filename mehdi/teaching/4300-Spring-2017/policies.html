            <h3>Attendance Policy</h3>
              <ul>
            <li>Attendance for this course is based on a random sampling. Every once in a while, there will be unannounced, in-class exercises (so called Pop Quizzes) that are to be turned in. These will be used to compute your attendance and participation grade. <br/><em><strong> Important: no make-ups for quizzes will be given.</strong></em> </li>
            <li>If you are going to be absent on the day of  an examination, you must provide a University-approved excuse for your  absence BEFORE the day of the examination.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <h3>Make-up Exams</h3>
            <ul>
            	<li>Students may only make up an exam under exceptional circumstances, such as family or medical emergencies, and must have this absence approved by the instructor.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Student use of Technology in the Classroom</h3>
            <ul>
            	<li>Access to the Internet can be a valuable aid to the classroom-learning environment. However, unless otherwise noted, in-class use of technology (e.g., laptops, smartphones, tablets, etc.) is permitted <em><strong>exclusively</strong></em> for taking class notes. Students are discouraged from using technology in ways that distract from the learning community (e.g. Facebook, texting, work for other classes, etc.) and if found doing so, will be asked to leave the classroom for the day and will not get credit for attendance that class period if attendance was taken.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Late Submissions of projects and homeworks</h3>
            <ul>
            	<li>All team projects must be submitted on time.</li>
            	<li>A 10% penalty will be assessed for each late day for individually assigned projects and homeworks. The assignment will not be graded (you will receive zero) if the assignment is more than 3 days late. Note that a weekend counts just as regular days. For example, if an assignment is due Friday and is turned in Monday, it is 3 days late. Note that if your assignment is even one second late, it is considered late, and corresponding penalties will be applied.</li>
                <li>If you are sick and have appropriate documentation, <em><strong>always let me know as soon as you get sick.</strong></em> It will be to your disadvantage to tell me after the fact that you were sick; you may not be excused from the regular due date.</li>
                <li>Note that <strong>scheduled</strong> downtimes of <span class="code_format">nike</span> or other CS systems and network are not an excuse for late submission.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Academic Honesty</h3>
            <ul>
            <li>As a University of Georgia student, you have agreed to abide by the University's academic honesty policy, "A Culture of Honesty," and the Student Honor Code. All academic work must meet the standards described in "A Culture of Honesty" found at: <a rel="external" href="http://www.uga.edu/honesty" target="_blank">http://www.uga.edu/honesty</a>. Lack of knowledge of the academic honesty policy is not a reasonable explanation for a violation. Questions related to course assignments and the academic honesty policy should be directed to the instructor.</li>
            <li>The Computer Science Department recognizes honesty and integrity as necessary to the academic function of the University. Therefore all students are reminded that the CS faculty requires compliance with the conduct regulations found in the Uni- versity of Georgia Student Handbook. Academic honesty means that any work you submit is your own work.<br/><br/>
            Common forms of academic dishonesty, which students should guard against, are:
            <ul>
            	<li>copying from another studentâ€™s test paper or laboratory report, or allowing another student to copy from you;</li>
                <li>fabricating data (computer, statistical) for an assignment;</li>
                <li>helping another student to write a laboratory report or computer software code that the student will present as his own work, or accepting such help and presenting the work as your own;</li>
                <li>turning in material from a public source such as a book or the Internet as your own work.</li>
            </ul><br/>
            Three steps to help prevent academic dishonesty are:
            <ul>
            	<li>Familiarize yourself with the regulations.</li>
                <li>If you have any doubt about what constitutes academic dishonesty, ask your instructor or a staff member at the Office of the Vice President for Instruction.</li>
                <li>Refuse to assist students who want to cheat.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>In addition to the terms expressed above, you also agree not to make any portion of your assignments for this class publicly available for others to view. This includes, but is not limited to, posting snippets of your code on help websites. Engaging in activities similar to this will be seen as either giving or receiving unauthorized assistance. With regard to question and answer websites (e.g., StackOverflow, Yahoo Answers, etc.), you may ask general questions about programming on such websites that relate to your assignments in this class, however, you must phrase such questions in a way that make them independent of the specific problem you are having.</li>
            <li>If you need specific help with portions of your code, then you must consult with the instructor or teaching assistants first (unless expressly and explicitly stated otherwise in the assignment description). Furthermore, if you copy or extend material from the Web (in any fashion) or other sources and incorporate that material into the submission for one of your assignments then you must cite where you got the code from in order to avoid plagiarism.</li>
            <li>All faculty, staff and students are encouraged to report all suspected cases of academic dishonesty. All cases of suspected academic dishonesty (cheating) will be referred to the Office of the Vice President for Instruction for academic dishonesty. Penalties imposed by the Office of the Vice President for Instruction may include a failing grade in the course and a notation on the student's transcript. Repeated violations are punishable by expulsion from the University. For further information please refer to the UGA Code of Conduct, available at: <a target="_blank" href="http://conduct.uga.edu/code_of_conduct/index.html">The University of Georgia Code of Conduct</a></li>
            <li>Note that copying materials from the Web is a violation of academic honesty. There are many other schools that teach Java; it is even possible that there may be code posted that could help you on an assignment. Copying anything from any Web site is forbidden and will be considered exactly as cheating on assignment. Furthermore, accepting code written by other students in previous or current offerings of this class will be considered a violation of the academic honesty policy.</li>
            <li><em><strong>Unfamiliarity with the rules and regulations of the academic honesty environment at the University of Georgia will not be grounds for leniency.</strong></em></li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Policy for Re-grades</h3>
            <ul>
            	<li>You may request a re-grade of any graded item any time within 7 calendar days (i.e., not 7 class days) of receiving the grade. To make a request, you should submit a written justification for the request via email to your instructor.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Additional Information</h3>
            <ul>
            	<li>Students with a disability or health-related issue who need a class accommodation should make an appointment to speak with the instructor as soon as possible.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Email</h3>
            <ul>
            	<li>When emailing the instructor or TA, please include a <span class="code_format">[cs4300]</span> tag in the subject line. Note, we receive a lot of email, so it sometimes takes us a while to sort through our inboxes. Please allow 24-hours for a response on a weekday, and 48- hours for a response on the weekend or holiday/break.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3><em>Remember, the course syllabus is a general plan for the course; deviations announced to the class by the instructor may be necessary.</em></h3>
