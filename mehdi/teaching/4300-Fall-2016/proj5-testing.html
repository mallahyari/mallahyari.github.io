      <td width="620"><p>In order to test your program code existing on nike, you need to
        compile and execute it on one of the iMacs in the 307 lab. 
        The reason that You need to compile it on the iMac is that the version 
        of Java on the iMacs is older than the one on nike and the files 
        compiled on nike won't run properly on any of the iMacs. (Of course, it is possible to download your code from nike to your own system and run it there.)</p>
        <p>Important: if you used some newest features of Java (e.g., a switch 
          statement with string constants as case labels), you will need to 
          modify the program to compile on the older Java.  But this should be
          easy to do.</p>
        <p>Here is what you need to do:
          <br />
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Login to one of the iMacs (not one of the Windows systems!).</li>
          <li>Once you login, all of your file from nike are directly accessible 
            without having to ssh to nike.  In fact, you must not ssh to nike
            from the iMac!</li>
          <li>Open a terminal application (it is accessible from the Goto menu
            under the Utilities folder).  Once the terminal app opens a window
            for you, it's almost as if you ssh'ed to nike and were using Linux
            command line on nike.</li>
          <li>Navigate to your project 5 directory (using the cd command).</li>
          <li>Remove all previously compiled classes from the classes directory
            (if this is what you are using), but leave the classes directory
            intact.  That is, remove only the content of the directory, as in::
            <blockquote>
              <blockquote>
                <p class="fnt_fixed"> $  rm -r classes/*</p>
                </blockquote>
              </blockquote>
            </li>
          
          <li>Recompile your program on the iMac, just as you did on nike.
            For example, if you have the necessary jar files in the same
            project directory, you'd execute:
            <blockquote>
              <p class="fnt_fixed"> $  javac -d classes -cp mp3spi1.9.5.jar:tritonus_share.jar:jl1.0.1.jar src/edu/uga/cs1302/mytunes/*.java</p>
              </blockquote>
            </li>
          
          <li>Run the program on the iMac (again -- do not ssh to nike!):
            <blockquote>
              <p> $  java -cp classes:mp3spi1.9.5.jar:tritonus_share.jar:jl1.0.1.jar edu.uga.cs1302.mytunes.MyTunes music_directory<br />
                </p>
              </blockquote>
          </li>
          </ol>
        <p>The window (JFrame) should be created on the iMac and you should be
          able to see your program running on the iMac, using the graphical
          screen on the iMac.<br />
