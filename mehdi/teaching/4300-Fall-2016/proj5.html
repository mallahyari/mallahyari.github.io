            <p><strong>Due:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; July 29, 2016</strong></p>
  <table width="660" height="74" border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0">
    <tr>
      <td width="620"><p>In this project you will implement MyTunes, an improved version of your MP3 File Collection, developed in Project 4.  The improvements include the addition of a Graphical User Interface (GUI), which enables convenient viewing of the information about the songs in a collection (author, title, etc.), sorting and searching the songs by author, title, etc., and playing the selected songs.  As before, your program should be able to play an MP3 file and display some of the embedded tags in an MP3 file, such as title, author, album, and data, but all within a GUI interface.  New features include sorting and searching of your MP3 files by any of the tags.</p>
        <p class="style6"><strong>As before</strong>, <strong>this project involves dealing with mp3  files, and you must only use <em>legally</em> obtained mp3 files.</strong></p>
        In this project, you are also  required to extend your existing JavaDoc comments for all of your classes.
        <p>Submit your project directory to <span class="style4">cs1302a</span> on <span class="style4">nike</span>, a directory  called <span class="style4">Project5</span>  (using the <span class="style4">submit</span> command):</p>
        <ul>
          <li>All the source code, i.e. <span class="style4">.java</span> files (no need to include <span class="style4">.class</span> files).&nbsp; Javadoc comments are required. Of course, regular &ldquo;program logic&rdquo; comments  are required in your source code.&nbsp; As usual, your source code should be well  formatted.</li>
          <li>A <span class="style4">README.txt</span> file telling us how to compile your  program and how to execute it.</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
          <li>
            <p>Your  program must be in package <span class="style4">edu.uga.cs1302.mytunes</span>.</p>
            </li>
          <li>	Modify your implementation of the MP3File class to assign any undefined MP3 tags of author, title, and album to &rdquo;&rdquo; (an empty string). Set an undefined <em>date</em> of an MP3 file to the year 1900.  Also, add the following methods (you may add a suitable  instance variable):
            <p class="style4">int&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  getYear()<br />
              void&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  setYear(int year)</p>
            </li>
          <li>Implement a class called <span class="style4">MP3Collection</span>, which may be based on your <span class="style4">MyMP3Files</span> class developed in the previous project.&nbsp; This time, the new class should represent your  collection of <span class="style4">MP3Files</span> using Java's <span class="style4">LinkedList. </span>However, you must use only the <span class="style4">List&lt;E&gt;</span> interface to refer to the list.  Subsequently, provide the following public methods:
            <p><span class="style4">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MP3Collection()</span>              </p>

            </li>
          <br />
          <li>Create a Graphical User Interface (GUI) program, called <span class="style4">MyTunes</span>, serving as a manager of your collection.  The <span class="style4">MyTunes</span> program should be implemented using a <span class="style4">JFrame</span> with suitable  buttons, a text field, and other components, as needed. IMPORATANT: you must use  <span class="style4">JTable</span> component to represent the songs in your MP3 collection.  
            <br /><br />
            The <span class="style4">JTable</span> component should be initialized with the data obtained from the <span class="style4">getTableData</span> method in the <span class="style4">MP3Collection</span> class.  The columns should be labeled as <span class="style4">&rdquo;Author&rdquo;</span>, <span class="style4">&rdquo;Title&rdquo;</span>, <span class="style4">&rdquo;Album&rdquo;</span>, and <span class="style4">&rdquo;Year&rdquo;</span>. 
            <br /><br />
            The <span class="style4">MyTunes</span> program should provide GUI-like capabilities.  In particular, it should be possible to:<br /><br />
            <ul>
              <li><strong>View</strong> the MP3       files; scrolling up/down, if only a portion of the files fits within the       <span class="style4">JTable</span> view should also be possible. You should create a <span class="style4">JScrollPane</span> for the <span class="style4">JTable</span>. The usual functionality of a <span class="style4">JTable</span>,       such as resizing and repositioning the columns should be available, as       well.</li><br />
              <li><strong>Sort</strong> any of the       four columns (author, title, etc.) by clicking on the column header;       repeated clicks on the same column should reverse the sorting order. &nbsp;You should create a <span class="style4">TableRowSorter</span> for the <span class="style4">JTable</span>.</li><br />
              <li><strong>Filter</strong> the       shown MP3 files by providing a substring (it should be present in any of       the columns). The string to be used in filtering should be entered into a <span class="style4">JTextBox</span>,       and then pressing the <span class="style4">Enter</span> key should activate the filter.&nbsp; You should create a <span class="style4">RowFilter.regexFilter</span> (using a static       method) for the sorter used in the <span class="style4">JTable</span>.</li><br />
              <li><strong>Cancel </strong>an       existing filter by pressing a suitable button.</li><br />
              <li><strong>Play </strong>the       selected MP3 file (the selection should be within the <span class="style4">JTable</span> showing the MP3 files). Pressing the <span class="style4">Play</span> button should first invoke the <span class="style4">stopPlay()</span> method (in case a song is playing when the user selects a different song       to play) and then invoke the <span class="style4">startPlay()</span> method of the <span class="style4">MP3Collection</span>. A slightly modified version of the <span class="style4">MP3Player</span> class is on <span class="style4">nike</span>.</li><br />
              <li><strong>Stop</strong> the       playback of an MP3 file by pressing a suitable button. Pressing the <span class="style4">Stop</span> button should invoke the <span class="style4">stopPlay</span> method of the MP3Collection.</li><br />
              <li>Closing the <span class="style4">MyTunes</span> window (<span class="style4">JFrame</span>) should       terminate the program. You may add a <span class="style4">Quit</span> button, if you like.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              The three buttons (<span class="style4">Play</span>, <span class="style4">Stop</span>, <span class="style4">Cancel filter</span>) and the text box used for filtering should be located at the top of the frame, and the <span class="style4">JTable</span> should occupy the whole lower part of the <span class="style4">JFrame</span>.  You should use the <span class="style4">Box</span> layout (layout manager).            </p>
            <p>
              The <span class="style4">MyTunes</span> program should either accept a directory with the MP3 files as a command line argument, or, if not provided, use the directory called &ldquo;<span class="style4">Music</span>&rdquo; in the current directory.</p></li>
          
          <li>You should provide <span class="style4">Javadoc</span> comments in your program. However, no <span class="style4">JUnit</span> testing is required in this project.</li><br />
          <li>Additional information will be provided in class, on eLC, and on the class Web site.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="style6"><strong>Things to note:</strong></p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Ethics  note:</strong> remember that you should not use <em>illegally</em>  obtained mp3 files for your listening pleasure, or to test your program.&nbsp; There are web sites that offer mp3 files for  free (for example, <a href="http://www.indierockcafe.com/" target="_blank">www.indierockcafe.com</a>, <a href="http://www.acidplanet.com/">www.acidplanet.com</a>,  or free music downloads from <span class="style4">amazon.com</span>).&nbsp;  Many bands and individual musicians offer free samples of their music,  as well.&nbsp; You should use only <em>legally</em> obtained music files. Please, consult the legal statement of the site from which you are downloading files. Remember that even thought the files may be free, that may not give you the right to share the files with others!</li>
          <li>All of your classes must be in package <span class="style4">edu.uga.cs1302.mytunes</span>.</li>
          <li>Your must use your modified SimpleArrayList<span class="style4"></span> to store <span class="style4">MP3File</span> objects.&nbsp; </li>
          <li>You must provide suitable JavaDoc comments for your classes, methods, and constants.</li>
          <li>Your design should be reasonably efficient, and  in accordance with object oriented design principles (encapsulation, information  hiding, inheritance, etc.).</li>
