           	<h2 style="text-align:center">Project 2: Servlet and JDBC Programming </h2>
            <p><strong>Due:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; September 20, 2016</strong><span style="color: red"> (Extended)</span></p>
            <p>In this project you will create a web application to get information about <em>actors</em>, <em>directors</em> and <em>movies</em>. You must use the MySQL database called <span class="code_format">imdb</span> (see below) to retrieve the information about <em>actors</em>, <em>directors</em> and <em>movies</em>. The user name and password are given on <span class="code_format">wp420</span> in the directory <span class="code_format">~/mehdi/cs4300/dbinfo.txt</span>.</p>
        <h3>Turn In</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Submit a directory with your complete application to the user <span class="code_format">cs4300b</span> on <span class="code_format">nike.cs.uga.edu</span>. Include all the source code, i.e. <span class="code_format">.java</span> files.&nbsp; NOTICE: Comments  are <em>required</em> in your source code!  These comments should make it easy to read and follow the logic of your code.&nbsp; Also, your source code should be well  formatted. Also include the Web application directory structure, and the final (deployed) WAR archive file.</li>
          <li>A <span class="code_format">README</span>.txt file providing the complete URL to use when invoking your application.</li>
          </ul>
       
        <h3>Project  description:</h3>
        <p>Your  application must have an HTML file called <span class="code_format">movie.html</span>. This html file has an HTML form. The user should be able to use the HTML form to specify the their items of interest (i.e. <em>actors</em>, <em>directors</em> or <em>movies</em>) they need to get information about. You may use lists, text fields, and buttons as form elements. After the form has been submitted by the user, the application should retrieve the information about the selected item from the <span class="code_format">imdb</span> database, and return the response HTML page with a listing of all information about the selected item.</p>
        <p>In case a user enters an unknown term, the application should return an error page with a suitable error message. </p>
        <p>It is your responsibility to discover the column names and create a suitable SQL query to retrieve the required data.  For example, you may use the <span class="code_format">mysql</span> command to connect to the <span class="code_format">imdb</span> database and then discover the table names, as well as the defined columns and their types.</p>
        <p>Your application <em>must</em> utilize a Java servlet and an   HTML form.&nbsp; The application&rsquo;s WAR archive  must have a name of the form <em>firstname_lastname</em>_imdb.war and it must be deployed to our Wildfly Application Server on <span class="code_format">wp420</span> by copying the WAR  file to the directory <span class="code_format">/opt/wildfly/standalone/deployments/project2</span>.&nbsp; Remember to set the read permissions of the  WAR file to world-readable.&nbsp; In order to set the permissions, you need to run the following Unix command after you copied the file into the <span class="code_format">project2</span> directory.</p>
        <pre>chmod a+x /opt/wildfly/standalone/deployments/project2/firstname_lastname_imdb.war</pre>
<p>Your application must be  accessible at the following URL:</p>
<p style="margin-left:20px;">http://wp420.cs.uga.edu:8080/<em>firstname</em>_<em>lastname</em>_imdb/movie.html</p>
<p>(of course, substitute your name  in the URL above).</p>
<p>You have to use your username and password that were given in the class to able to connect to our server. The command to connect to our server is:
<pre>ssh your_username@wp420.cs.uga.edu</pre></p>

<strong>Important Notice: </strong> <em>Before you create (export) your <span class="code_format">.war</span> file and deploy it on the server, please make sure you have changed the <strong>username</strong> and <strong>password</strong> to the correct ones for the database <span class="code_format">imdb</span> on the server. </em>
<h3>How to use MySQL database</h3>
<ul>
<li>You require to download and install MySQL available at <a href="http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/">here</a>. </li>
<li>You can connect to the MySQL database using the default username/password (root/given_password): 
<pre>mysql -uroot -pgiven_password</pre>
</li>
<li>Create a database and call it <span class="code_format">imdb</span>.</li> 
<li>Import the this <a href="resources/imdb.sql">imdb database</a> to your newly created <span class="code_format">imdb</span> database.
<li>Check to make sure the <span class="code_format">imdb</span> database has been populated successfully.</li>
